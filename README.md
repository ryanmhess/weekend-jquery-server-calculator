# Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 8 Hours_

1.  Initial login to app page:
    *   Upon first run of app, a function is called that performs a GET request and recevies calculation history data from the server
2.  First inputs:
    *   User may click calculator buttons to build an expression to evaluate
    *   No changes made if initial click is '='
    *   If initial click is an operator, the first number is assumed '0'
    *   If an operator is clicked and followed by '=', the second number is assumed '0'
    *   Limit use of '.' to once per number input, reset after operator or '='
    *   If operator is click, any additional operator clicks will alert user
    * The '=' will trigger a POST, adding latest calculation to history array, and then a GET, updating the DOM
3.  CE and AC inputs:
    *   The CE will 'clear entry' - This is for accidental inputs, using a wrong number or wrong operator, no affect on server history
    *   The AC will 'all clear' - This will completely delete the calculation history on the server side as well as any current entry on the client side
